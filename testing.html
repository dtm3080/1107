<h2>What is Computer Vision?</h2>
<p1><span>Computer vision is a field of computer science that tries to create computer systems that mimic how humans see, process and understand objects in our</span> <span>immediate environment. Cameras (still and video) are used in place of eyes which enables the computer system to 'see'; image processing algorithms are</span> <span>used to detect objects in the captured images . Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) process huge datasets and multiple algorithms to create artificial</span> neural networks which are designed to copy how the human brain understands what is captured by our eyes.
</p1>
<p><span>A CNN is a deep learning model whose output enables computer vision systems to make intelligent decisions, on their own (i.e., without further human input),</span> which distinguishes computer vision systems from machine learning systems.</p>
