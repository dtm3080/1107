<h2>What is Computer Vision?</h2>
<p>Computer vision is a field of computer science that tries to create computer systems that mimic how humans see, process and understand objects in our immediate environment. Cameras (still and video) are used in place of eyes which enables the computer system to “see”; image processing algorithms are used to detect objects in the captured images .Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) process huge datasets and multiple algorithms to create artificial neural networks which are designed to copy how the human brain understands what is captured by our eyes. A CNN is a deep learning model whose output enables computer vision systems to make intelligent decisions, on their own (i.e., without further human input), which distinguishes computer vision systems from machine learning systems.
