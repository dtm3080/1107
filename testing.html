<h2>Computer Vision?</h2>
<p1>	
	<span>Computer vision is a branch of computer science that aims to develop computer systems that replicate how people view, interpret, and comprehend items in their surroundings. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) handle large</span>
	<span>datasets and many algorithms to produce artificial neural networks that mimic how the human brain perceives what is collected by our eyes. A CNN is a deep learning model whose output allows computer vision systems to make</span>
	<span>intelligent judgments on their own (i.e. without the need for additional human input), distinguishing them from machine learning systems. While machine learning techniques were once employed for computer vision applications, deep</span>
	<span>learning approaches have emerged as a superior answer. For instance, machine learning techniques need a massive quantity of data and constant human supervision in the early stages to guarantee that the findings are as accurate as</span>
	<span>possible. Deep learning, on the other hand, is based on neural networks and solves problems using examples. It self-learns by recognizing common patterns in instances using labelled data. A bitmap picture is the foundation of all</span>
	<span>computer vision algorithms.</span>
</p1>
<p>
	<span>The bitmap picture is made up of a grid of pixels, whether it's from a digital (still) camera or a single video frame (i.e. moving pictures). Because a pixel is the smallest addressable unit in a bitmap, it may be captured and </span>
	<span>processed as a two-dimensional array by computer vision algorithms. The brightness of a pixel is measured by its intensity. For an 8-bit grayscale image, the computer system sees each pixel as a number (e.g., between the</span>
	<span>RGB values 0 and 255). When a bitmap is examined at the pixel level, computer vision techniques may be used to discover the edges of objects, which may then be used to categorise them into recognisable categories.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span>In today's world, when every sector is seeking to improve its systems and make them more streamlined and efficient, Computer Vision is critical. Computer vision is defined as the provision of sight or visual skills to computers</span>
	<span>in order to assist them in making better judgments much faster, more efficiently, and consistently than humans could.Computer vision is being more widely used in a variety of businesses throughout the world. Theft detection, retail businesses, healthcare systems, autonomous automobiles, industrial sectors, quality evaluation, and other applications are increasingly relying on computer vision. And by incorporating Computer Vision into their operations, each sector has benefited greatly. People upload more than 1.8 billion photographs every day, according to a research by Internet Trends, and that's just the amount of photos. This is without taking the consideration of how much higher the figure would be if photographs on phones were included. Every day, we watch over 4,146,600 YouTube videos and send over 103,447,520 spam emails. Again, that's only a portion of it; communication, media, and entertainment, as well as the internet of things, all play a role in this total. This abundance of visual material requires analysis and comprehension. By training machines to "see" these photographs and movies, computer vision helps in this procedure.</span>
