<h2>What is Computer Vision?</h2>
<p1>	
	<span>Computer vision is a branch of computer science that aims to develop computer systems that replicate how people view, interpret, and comprehend items in their surroundings. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) handle large</span>
	<span>datasets and many algorithms to produce artificial neural networks that mimic how the human brain perceives what is collected by our eyes. A CNN is a deep learning model whose output allows computer vision systems to make</span>
	<span>intelligent judgments on their own (i.e. without the need for additional human input), distinguishing them from machine learning systems. While machine learning techniques were once employed for computer vision applications, deep</span>
	<span>learning approaches have emerged as a superior answer. For instance, machine learning techniques need a massive quantity of data and constant human supervision in the early stages to guarantee that the findings are as accurate as</span>
	<span>possible. Deep learning, on the other hand, is based on neural networks and solves problems using examples. It self-learns by recognizing common patterns in instances using labelled data. A bitmap picture is the foundation of all</span>
	<span>computer vision algorithms. </span>
