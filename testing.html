<h2>Computer Vision?</h2>
<p>	
	<span>Computer vision is a branch of computer science that aims to develop computer systems that replicate how people view, interpret, and comprehend items in their surroundings. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) handle large</span>
	<span>datasets and many algorithms to produce artificial neural networks that mimic how the human brain perceives what is collected by our eyes. A CNN is a deep learning model whose output allows computer vision systems to make</span>
	<span>intelligent judgments on their own (i.e. without the need for additional human input), distinguishing them from machine learning systems. While machine learning techniques were once employed for computer vision applications,</span>
	<span>deep learning approaches have emerged as a superior answer. For instance, machine learning techniques need a massive quantity of data and constant human supervision in the early stages to guarantee that the findings are as accurate as</span>
	<span>possible. Deep learning, on the other hand, is based on neural networks and solves problems using examples. It self-learns by recognizing common patterns in instances using labelled data. A bitmap picture is the foundation of all</span>
	<span>computer vision algorithms.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span>The bitmap picture is made up of a grid of pixels, whether it's from a digital (still) camera or a single video frame (i.e. moving pictures). Because a pixel is the smallest addressable unit in a bitmap, it may be captured and </span>
	<span>processed as a two-dimensional array by computer vision algorithms. The brightness of a pixel is measured by its intensity. For an 8-bit grayscale image, the computer system sees each pixel as a number (e.g., between the</span>
	<span>RGB values 0 and 255). When a bitmap is examined at the pixel level, computer vision techniques may be used to discover the edges of objects, which may then be used to categorise them into recognisable categories.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span>In today's world, when every sector is seeking to improve its systems and make them more streamlined and efficient, Computer Vision is critical. Computer vision is defined as the provision of sight or visual skills to computers</span>
	<span>in order to assist them in making better judgments much faster, more efficiently, and consistently than humans could.Computer vision is being more widely used in a variety of businesses throughout the world. Theft detection, retail businesses, healthcare systems, autonomous automobiles, industrial sectors, quality evaluation, and other applications are increasingly relying on computer vision. And by incorporating Computer Vision into their operations, each sector has benefited greatly. People upload more than 1.8 billion photographs every day, according to a research by Internet Trends, and that's just the amount of photos. This is without taking the consideration of how much higher the figure would be if photographs on phones were included. Every day, we watch over 4,146,600 YouTube videos and send over 103,447,520 spam emails. Again, that's only a portion of it; communication, media, and entertainment, as well as the internet of things, all play a role in this total. This abundance of visual material requires analysis and comprehension. By training machines to "see" these photographs and movies, computer vision helps in this procedure.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span>Furthermore, today's internet is easily available to everyone because of improved connections. Online abuse and "toxicity" are especially harmful to children. Aside from automating a variety of tasks, computer vision also guarantees that online visual material is moderated and monitored. Indexing is one of the most important aspects of online material curation. Because most of the stuff on the internet is of two categories, text, visual, and audio, categorising it is simple. Algorithms are used in computer vision to read and index pictures. Computer vision is used by popular search engines like Google and Youtube to approve photos and videos for inclusion. They not only supply consumers with appropriate material, but they also safeguard them against online harassment and "toxicity."</span>
</p>

<h2>Opportunity:</h2>
<h4>	
	<span>There are many advantages about computer vision based systems:</span>
</h4>
<p>
	<span><li>Improve Accuracy:</li></span>
	<span>One of the most significant benefits of computer vision is that it can be more precise than human vision. The human brain is so incredible that it can complete pictures with only a few bits of data. It might also make it difficult to see what is truly there. However, because our brains make assumptions, the full image isn't always accurate—try several optical illusions to see for yourself. Computer vision can also work at the pixel level, which is a degree of detail that the human brain is incapable of processing. This helps computers to provide more precise findings, which can be useful in applications such as early cancer screening utilising image-based detection. Healthcare is an important industry, and computer vision is becoming more important in evaluating medical pictures and properly identifying numerous disorders. With additional advancements in cutting-edge technology, medical imaging analysis will improve for more accurate forecasts. An example is x-ray. X-rays are one of the most often utilized medical pictures in hospitals to detect illnesses and detect abnormalities in the human body's organs. With more accurate training data generated by medical picture annotations, computer vision may learn comparable patterns and train machine learning algorithms to learn and predict in the near future.</span>
</p><p>
	<span><li>Deliver Faster Results:</li></span>
	<span>Although the brain is quick and efficient, computers are superior at multitasking, allowing them to give faster results in particular applications. Computers may also be set up to do certain tasks over extended periods of time. For example a person labelling and classifying a batch of 10,000 photographs for an e-commerce site, may take six or more hours, not considering breaks and life's unavoidable distractions. Or an online book shop utilises picture verification to automatically choose the best thumbnails for product pages, which is an example of this sort of computer vision application. Using computer vision to do this activity not only produces faster results, but it also frees up time to focus on higher-level activities that genuinely demand the human brain. Using computer vision to interpret X-ray pictures in a hospital context allows for speedier diagnosis, which might lead to speedier care at critical periods. Computer vision has recently been utilised to quickly detect COVID-19 instances.</span>
</p><p>
	<span><li>Reduce Costs:</li></span>
	<span>After being taught, a computer can accomplish the same activities with little effort—and it can even learn while doing so. This can help you save a lot of time and money by reducing the amount of physical work you have to put in. One example is the use of computer vision in surveillance systems to identify shrinkage in retail stores. Surveillance camera data may be used to discover shop shelf gaps, urging businesses to supply popular goods and assisting them in identifying purchase trends. Whether the funds saved by utilising computer vision are used to hire more employees to undertake higher-level activities or to cover other costs associated with developing a firm, this technology saves money.Computer vision may also be used to detect moods when people browse and examine various things in a store. Stores can cut inventory expenses by removing unpopular goods using this method.</span>
<p>
	<span><li>Provide Unbiased Results:</li></span>
	<span>When a computer examines a picture with a specific objective in mind, unnecessary information is ignored. This helps to limit the sorts of bias that people, whether purposely or accidentally, may inject into a process. For example, when an insurance adjuster looks at images of a damaged vehicle, they might become biased by the surrounding context, such as symbols of wealth, human expressions, and so on. However, when a computer analyzes the image, it looks only at the vehicle and the damage it sustained, providing an objective analysis of the insurance claim.</span>
</p>

<h2>Risk:</h2>
<p>
	<span><li>Reasoning Issue:</li></span>
	<span> Modern neural network-based algorithms are complicated systems with a lot of moving parts. It's difficult to discern the rationale behind any work in these conditions. This loss of logic makes defining any characteristic in an image or video difficult for computer vision specialists.</span>
</p><p>
	<span><li>Privacy and Ethics:</li></span>
	<span>In many nations, vision-based monitoring poses a severe danger to privacy. It puts people at risk of unlawful data usage. Because of these issues, face recognition and detection are outlawed in various nations. Due to this this can have a major impact in our society if our personal privacy is leaked to the modern society, which can lead to many problems like blackmailing and exposing passcodes to major departments around the globe.</span>
</p><p>
	<span><li>Fake Content</li></span>
	<span>Computer vision, like many other technologies, may be deadly in the wrong hands. Anyone with access to high-capacity data centres may create false photos, movies, or text material. This can really affect the future of computer vision and the future of all technologies that are based upon computer vision. Because if the computer vision system is fed incorrect information about a certain problem or category it will start to develop incorrect results which can lead to major accidents or issues around the globe. An example could be self-driving cars, if it is feeding in lanes or roads so that it knows and can identify it will travel on the roads/lanes, but if it is fed in footpaths then it will also consider footpaths as road/lanes which can lead to major injuries. This can be problematic if hackers or wrongdoing people input incorrect information into the computer vision systems.</span>
<p>
	<span><li>Adversarial Attacks:</li></span>
	<span>These are computer-generated visual illusions. When an attacker designs a defective machine learning model, they aim for it to fail the machine that uses it. These faulty models are difficult to spot and can seriously harm any system.</span>
