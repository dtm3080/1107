<h2>Computer Vision?</h2>
<p>	
	<span>Computer vision is a branch of computer science that aims to develop computer systems that replicate how people view, interpret, and comprehend items in their surroundings. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) handle large</span>
	<span>datasets and many algorithms to produce artificial neural networks that mimic how the human brain perceives what is collected by our eyes. A CNN is a deep learning model whose output allows computer vision systems to make</span>
	<span>intelligent judgments on their own (i.e. without the need for additional human input), distinguishing them from machine learning systems. While machine learning techniques were once employed for computer vision applications,</span>
	<span>deep learning approaches have emerged as a superior answer. For instance, machine learning techniques need a massive quantity of data and constant human supervision in the early stages to guarantee that the findings are as</span>
	<span>accurate as possible. Deep learning, on the other hand, is based on neural networks and solves problems using examples. It self-learns by recognizing common patterns in instances using labelled data. A bitmap picture is the</span>
	<span>foundation of all computer vision algorithms.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span>The bitmap picture is made up of a grid of pixels, whether it's from a digital (still) camera or a single video frame (i.e. moving pictures). Because a pixel is the smallest addressable unit in a bitmap, it may be captured and </span>
	<span>processed as a two-dimensional array by computer vision algorithms. The brightness of a pixel is measured by its intensity. For an 8-bit grayscale image, the computer system sees each pixel as a number (e.g., between the</span>
	<span>RGB values 0 and 255). When a bitmap is examined at the pixel level, computer vision techniques may be used to discover the edges of objects, which may then be used to categorise them into recognisable categories.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span>In today's world, when every sector is seeking to improve its systems and make them more streamlined and efficient, Computer Vision is critical. Computer vision is defined as the provision of sight or visual skills to computers</span>
	<span>in order to assist them in making better judgments much faster, more efficiently, and consistently than humans could.Computer vision is being more widely used in a variety of businesses throughout the world. Theft detection, retail businesses, healthcare systems, autonomous automobiles, industrial sectors, quality evaluation, and other applications are increasingly relying on computer vision. And by incorporating Computer Vision into their operations, each sector has benefited greatly. People upload more than 1.8 billion photographs every day, according to a research by Internet Trends, and that's just the amount of photos. This is without taking the consideration of how much higher the figure would be if photographs on phones were included. Every day, we watch over 4,146,600 YouTube videos and send over 103,447,520 spam emails. Again, that's only a portion of it; communication, media, and entertainment, as well as the internet of things, all play a role in this total. This abundance of visual material requires analysis and comprehension. By training machines to "see" these photographs and movies, computer vision helps in this procedure.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span>Furthermore, today's internet is easily available to everyone because of improved connections. Online abuse and "toxicity" are especially harmful to children. Aside from automating a variety of tasks, computer vision also guarantees that online visual material is moderated and monitored. Indexing is one of the most important aspects of online material curation. Because most of the stuff on the internet is of two categories, text, visual, and audio, categorising it is simple. Algorithms are used in computer vision to read and index pictures. Computer vision is used by popular search engines like Google and Youtube to approve photos and videos for inclusion. They not only supply consumers with appropriate material, but they also safeguard them against online harassment and "toxicity."</span>
</p>

<h2>Opportunity:</h2>
<h4>	
	<span>There are many advantages about computer vision based systems:</span>
</h4>
<p>
	<span><li>Improve Accuracy:</li></span>
	<span>One of the most significant benefits of computer vision is that it can be more precise than human vision. The human brain is so incredible that it can complete pictures with only a few bits of data. It might also make it difficult to see what is truly there. However, because our brains make assumptions, the full image isn't always accurate—try several optical illusions to see for yourself. Computer vision can also work at the pixel level, which is a degree of detail that the human brain is incapable of processing. This helps computers to provide more precise findings, which can be useful in applications such as early cancer screening utilising image-based detection. Healthcare is an important industry, and computer vision is becoming more important in evaluating medical pictures and properly identifying numerous disorders. With additional advancements in cutting-edge technology, medical imaging analysis will improve for more accurate forecasts. An example is x-ray. X-rays are one of the most often utilized medical pictures in hospitals to detect illnesses and detect abnormalities in the human body's organs. With more accurate training data generated by medical picture annotations, computer vision may learn comparable patterns and train machine learning algorithms to learn and predict in the near future.</span>
</p><p>
	<span><li>Deliver Faster Results:</li></span>
	<span>Although the brain is quick and efficient, computers are superior at multitasking, allowing them to give faster results in particular applications. Computers may also be set up to do certain tasks over extended periods of time. For example a person labelling and classifying a batch of 10,000 photographs for an e-commerce site, may take six or more hours, not considering breaks and life's unavoidable distractions. Or an online book shop utilises picture verification to automatically choose the best thumbnails for product pages, which is an example of this sort of computer vision application. Using computer vision to do this activity not only produces faster results, but it also frees up time to focus on higher-level activities that genuinely demand the human brain. Using computer vision to interpret X-ray pictures in a hospital context allows for speedier diagnosis, which might lead to speedier care at critical periods. Computer vision has recently been utilised to quickly detect COVID-19 instances.</span>
</p><p>
	<span><li>Reduce Costs:</li></span>
	<span>After being taught, a computer can accomplish the same activities with little effort—and it can even learn while doing so. This can help you save a lot of time and money by reducing the amount of physical work you have to put in. One example is the use of computer vision in surveillance systems to identify shrinkage in retail stores. Surveillance camera data may be used to discover shop shelf gaps, urging businesses to supply popular goods and assisting them in identifying purchase trends. Whether the funds saved by utilising computer vision are used to hire more employees to undertake higher-level activities or to cover other costs associated with developing a firm, this technology saves money.Computer vision may also be used to detect moods when people browse and examine various things in a store. Stores can cut inventory expenses by removing unpopular goods using this method.</span>
<p>
	<span><li>Provide Unbiased Results:</li></span>
	<span>When a computer examines a picture with a specific objective in mind, unnecessary information is ignored. This helps to limit the sorts of bias that people, whether purposely or accidentally, may inject into a process. For example, when an insurance adjuster looks at images of a damaged vehicle, they might become biased by the surrounding context, such as symbols of wealth, human expressions, and so on. However, when a computer analyzes the image, it looks only at the vehicle and the damage it sustained, providing an objective analysis of the insurance claim.</span>
</p>

<h2>Risk:</h2>
<h4>	
	<span>Just as there are advantages there is also disadvantages about computer vision based systems:</span>
</h4>
<p>
	<span><li>Reasoning Issue:</li></span>
	<span> Modern neural network-based algorithms are complicated systems with a lot of moving parts. It's difficult to discern the rationale behind any work in these conditions. This loss of logic makes defining any characteristic in an image or video difficult for computer vision specialists.</span>
</p><p>
	<span><li>Privacy and Ethics:</li></span>
	<span>In many nations, vision-based monitoring poses a severe danger to privacy. It puts people at risk of unlawful data usage. Because of these issues, face recognition and detection are outlawed in various nations. Due to this this can have a major impact in our society if our personal privacy is leaked to the modern society, which can lead to many problems like blackmailing and exposing passcodes to major departments around the globe.</span>
</p><p>
	<span><li>Fake Content</li></span>
	<span>Computer vision, like many other technologies, may be deadly in the wrong hands. Anyone with access to high-capacity data centres may create false photos, movies, or text material. This can really affect the future of computer vision and the future of all technologies that are based upon computer vision. Because if the computer vision system is fed incorrect information about a certain problem or category it will start to develop incorrect results which can lead to major accidents or issues around the globe. An example could be self-driving cars, if it is feeding in lanes or roads so that it knows and can identify it will travel on the roads/lanes, but if it is fed in footpaths then it will also consider footpaths as road/lanes which can lead to major injuries. This can be problematic if hackers or wrongdoing people input incorrect information into the computer vision systems.</span>
<p>
	<span><li>Adversarial Attacks:</li></span>
	<span>These are computer-generated visual illusions. When an attacker designs a defective machine learning model, they aim for it to fail the machine that uses it. These faulty models are difficult to spot and can seriously harm any system. The most concerning element of adversarial attack is its portability, not only across different machine learning systems and training sets, but also into fields other than computer vision. In 2018, University of California researchers proved that by adding an adversarial perturbation to a soundwave (voice recording), it is simple to totally alter the speech-to-text transcription to a specific phrase or even hide speech information in other forms of audio.</span>
</p>

<h2>Choices:</h2>
<p>
	<span>Every year AI and CV are becoming more popular among business owners. Over the past decade, Artificial Intelligence has dramatically evolved within the market and no doubt it will only grow. According to MarketsandMarkets research, the Artificial Intelligence market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025. Computer vision techniques that have recently become topical in the past decade in the field of computer vision research. The recent trends of the past decade in computer vision have been continuing to merge the fields of vision and graphics. Many new trends include techniques like image stitching, rendering and high dynamic range (HDR) capture. Since such computer vision techniques are used in everyday photography and filming, they are labeled under a single term computational photography. The second emerging trend of computer vision is feature-based techniques, which are combined with learning for recognition applications. Recognition based techniques dominate tasks such as face recognition, scene recognition, location recognition, or action and motion recognition. The third prominent trend, which is currently topical in visual research, is the use of computer vision techniques in the setting of the Internet. This trend has become more profound with the availability of immense quantities of data on the Internet. The large amount of available data makes it more feasible to learn categories of objects from images without the assistance of a human. Search engines have also been made to utilize various computer vision techniques.</span>
	<span>Another reason why computer vision is growing rapidly in a multitude of areas. This is because computer vision is used in industrial and manufacturing applications to find components on a conveyor belt, diagnose faults, and help a robot in eliminating bad parts. Retail video systems can follow personnel and consumers throughout a store, and security systems can provide automated monitoring. Computer vision is also a key component of self-driving cars. A person or another vehicle is behind the automobile or in a blind area, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) will warn the driver. When computer vision factors are combined with artificial intelligence (AI), their capabilities can be expanded in new and significant ways. Object detection, for example, is a fundamental function of a computer vision system. Scanning a region of interest inside the range of view to see if the backdrop changes is a basic implementation of object detection. With AI, object detection can be implemented in more complex situations, such as with the background changing as a vehicle backs up. Object detection can now be used in more complicated scenarios, such as when the background changes as a vehicle backs up, thanks to AI.</span>

<h2>Ethical issues</h2>
<h4>Harshil Patel</h4>
<p>
	<span>Throughout the many years the computer vision field entails a wide range of approaches to a wide range of visual issues. It has been quickly changing over the last decade, with the introduction of a slew of new computer vision technology and applications. However just like other technologies and systems this system computer vision has many  ethical issues surrounding its applications. One is spying, which is often heavily related to surveillance. Because of the nature of monitoring, the technologies automatically risk people's privacy and security. Passive monitoring of people is done in the guise of security, however with the existence of computer vision technology, such as facial recognition, the identities of passively observed people may be easily obtained. Another ethical issue is identity theft, which is known as the second most concerning problem in computer vision. Identity theft is the act of stealing another person's identity for bad objectives such as gaining advantages under another person's name. Credit cards, passports, and driver's licences are examples of personal data that may be stolen. Image classification in computer vision can properly categorize pictures that may include sensitive information.  Discrimination also plays an important factor in ethical issues which computer vision has. Computer vision systems that can differentiate between skin color and ethnicity-related face traits can be used to discriminate particular groups of people based on their criminal proclivity. These persons can be discriminated against based on their skin colour, regardless of whether they are guilty or not. The third most significant ethical concern in computer vision is malicious assaults. Criminals' intents to hack or break into networks for different goals, or to send harmful material to targets, are referred to as malicious attacks. With the introduction of such computer vision applications to surveillance, a variety of concerns arise. The majority of these concerns are about the privacy of those being watched, as well as the security of video surveillance systems against targeted attacks and misuse. In comparison to traditional analogue video surveillance, digital footage can be readily saved and stored, and computer vision technology allows for the extraction of behavior patterns not only from the culprits but also from the wider populace.</span>

<h4>Mangkaled Pongpumpiched</h4>
<p>
	<span>Nowadays, the ethical issue of technology is a common problem on the Internet. First, movie infringement is a common thing that you can find on the internet. Second, Using code without permission or not from open-source code. These are the big problems for movie makers or heavy programmers who are used by others without permission for their own profit. The solution to these problems is simple, but most people like the convenience of not taking into account the ethical issues of technology because it's easy to access and do not have to pay the money or pay the money less than buy copyrighted goods. For example, most people might like to watch movies through websites that show movies without permission. Because I did not buy a CD to watch and can still watch it anywhere, anytime as well. These problems will be gone if everyone helps each other to support copyrighted products and not use web services that bring content or information without permission from the owner and do not use a programmer services who sells other people's open-source code for their own profit. However, these problems might not be solved either now or in the future. Because in this world there will be some people who like to be comfortable regardless of technological ethics and still support pirated stuff.</span>
</p>
	
<h4>Kapil Patel</h4>
<p>
	<span>Computer vision is a field of study that encompasses a variety of methods to a variety of visual problems. It has been rapidly evolving over the last decade, with the development of several other new technologies and applications that make use of various computer vision techniques. The goal of this is to explore ethical concerns about existing computer vision applications.
The act of spying on or gathering data about individuals without their agreement is described as espionage. Individuals and organisations can engage in espionage, which is a major invasion of an individual's privacy from an ethical standpoint. When photographs are shared through social networks, automatic picture classification might generate privacy issues. With the act of sharing photographs on the internet, information is leaked, allowing unwanted individuals or parties to snoop on the person.
Identity theft is the process of taking another person's identity for unethical objectives such as gaining benefits in another person's name. Credit cards, passports, and driver's licences are examples of personal data that can be stolen. Image classification in computer vision can accurately classify images that may include sensitive information. Because picture classification can effectively indicate where sensitive information is located among a large collection of photographs or other media on a hard drive, sensitive data extraction becomes simple and quick. For example, If the attacker has access to the victim's computer, they can search the hard drive for sensitive photographs or other information. Attackers can easily commit fraud such as identity theft by accurately classifying and extracting this type of sensitive information from photographs. 
Some computer vision systems were shown to have an ethical issue with copyright infringement. Copyright infringement is defined as the unauthorised use of another's intellectual property without their permission or consent. Trademarks, patents, and other copyrighted content are examples of copyrighted material. Several huge medical image databases are becoming publically available in order to improve system performance, but the databases are vulnerable to patient privacy breaches and may contain copyrighted or private photographs
To improve the efficiency of surveillance systems, computer vision technologies are used in video surveillance. It is used for a variety of applications, including identifying and tracking items such as suspects and cars, as well as detecting suspicious activity or emergency circumstances. It makes tracking of behaviour patterns mandatory, which can have negative effects for individuals and lead to discriminatory actions. As a result, innocent persons may face discrimination and be automatically labelled as suspects based on their actions. When members of a certain group are assessed and punished based on group characteristics that are not necessarily valid in determining whether they are guilty or not, it raises major ethical difficulties.
Many software frameworks are available for usage with new emerging computer vision technology. As a result, the field of computer vision research has become quite hot, with numerous sub-domains of applications and technologies. Face recognition, picture information retrieval, and computational photography are examples of these areas. Computer vision technologies are designed to automate and duplicate the human visual system. This necessitates a high level of picture processing, analysis, and learning. Questions about the ethical consequences of any fast evolving technology arise. Recent advances in the field of computer vision research have raised a number of issues and concerns that must be addressed in order to protect individuals' privacy and security.</span>
